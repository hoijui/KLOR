# KLOR KONRAD 3DP CASE FILES 

If you want to use the KLOR wireless (through ZMK) you need to choose the bluetooth case. If you plan on using it wired (through QMK) you should choose the regular case. The differences are a cutout for a JST connector in the bottom plate and another one for the ON/OFF switch in the side of the case.\

> **Note**
> You need a switchplate and the acrylic parts, no matter what case you choose.
